Tm is a setup script for tmux. It's an executable shell script so run tm help to see what it does.

tm looks for a .tmux file in the current directory. This file should contain commands to create a new window which will be attached to the current session. A new session will be started if necessary.

tm can create a .tmux file for you by using the new option.

don't forget to add .tmux to your .gitignore

the directory dottmux contains examples of my favorite layouts.

These can be used by adding the following links in home:
ln -s ~/Code/tm/dottmux/default .tmux.default
ln -s ~/Code/tm/dottmux/startup .tmux.startup

along with this for the config file:
ln -s ~/Code/tm/tmux.conf .tmux.conf

TODO:
tm will only work with the current directory. It needs to be able to accept a path on the command line and open a new window on that.
A different session can be specified when using the new option, but not without it. This needs to be consistent, either remove the ability to specify a different session or make it possible to specify a different session when running tm without the new option
